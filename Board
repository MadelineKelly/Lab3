//Idea: Create a Spot class that keeps track of whether or not the spot has been visited (true/false), and how many times we've back tracked to it.
//If we've only been in this spot once, make the first move of move8. If it's the second time (i.e. we backtracked once because we got stuck), make
//the second move of move8. And so on and so forth.
//If all options have been exhausted for every spot, then return "Failure."

//Things to do:
//take in starting square and start making moves
//mark as visited (true) when moved to
//put Spot info on a stack
//keep track of number of moves
//pop off stack and mark as false if we must backtrack
//determine whether or not we have failed
//What does last "()" value mean in their output for moving sequence?
//How do we back track when we get stuck? 
//      - Making sure we change the spots we visited back to false
//      - Keeping track of which moves we've already done we've been
//Do we want to use their getNextPos method or our own? //Mix of both
